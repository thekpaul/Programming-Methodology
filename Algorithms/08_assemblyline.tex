\chapter{Assembly-Line Scheduling Algorithm}
The objective of this challenge is to move from entry to exit point via stations
along two assembly lines. Each station has a fixed time of processing, and from
a station one can move to the next station along the line OR the next station on
the other assembly line. Elements can be of equal value.

\section{Brute Force}
With $n$ stations on each assembly line, there are $2^n$ possible ways to choose
stations. Therefore the brute force algorithm takes $\Omega\left(2^n\right)$ of
time complexity to be completely processed, making it infeasible.

\section{The Fastesy Way}
\imb{assemblyline.cpp}
With a simple loop algorithm and a minimum-evaluating process every iteration,
this process shows a time complexity of: \[ T(n)=\Theta(n) \]
