\chapter{Minimum Search on Rotated Array}
The objective of this challenge is to find the smallest element in an array
that was rotated at a random index after being sorted. Duplicate elements are
not allowed for this challenge.

\imb[34][39]{\alg/rotatedarray.cpp}
\imb[42][43]{\alg/rotatedarray.cpp}

By using a binary-search method with three nodes, the code above is successful
in finding and returning the smallest element. This algorithm uses recursive
functions, and shows the time complexity of the following:
\[ T(n)=2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+\alpha=4T\left(\frac{n}{4}\right)+3\alpha=
\cdots=2^kT\left(\frac{n}{2^k}\right)+\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\alpha,~\therefore T(n)=
O(\log n) \]

\section{With Duplicate Elements}
With duplicate elements, the time complexity cannot be kept at $\log n$. Follow-
up explanations for rotated arrays with duplicates will soon be committed.
