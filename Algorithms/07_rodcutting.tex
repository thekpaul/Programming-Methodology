\chapter{Rod Cutting Algorithm}
The objective of this challenge is to determine how to cut an imaginary rod to
receive the maximum revenue. Revenue per rod length and initial rod lengths are 
given. Note that, if the price for the initial rod length is high enough, the
optimal solution may require no cutting at all.

Since there are $n-1$ places to either cut or leave, there are $2^{n-1}$ ways in
total to cut a rod of $n$ inches. Therefore a brute force algorithm such as the
one presented solves all possible outcomes and finds the maximum value. Time
Complexity Analysis shows an exponential time function.
