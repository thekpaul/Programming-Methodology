\chapter{Finding the $\mathbf{k}$-th Smallest Number}
The objective of this challenge is to find the $k$-th smallest number in an
unsorted array. Some elements may be of equal value.

\section{Sort-and-Find}
This solution sorts the unsorted array and returning the value at index $k$. As
seen before, time complexity analysis indicates that this approach requires more
than $O(n\log n)$ amount of time. Since the sorting algorithm has already been
presented before, it will not be features again.

\section{Quick Select}
This solution is modeled after the Quicksort algorithm. Unlike Quicksort, this
algorithm only focuses on one side of the partition, and therefore its expected
running time is $T(n)=\Theta(n)$.
